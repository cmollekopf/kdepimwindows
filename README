== Tools ==
* alphacommander: http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/
* msysgit

== Requirements ==
* Python 3.4:
* Visual Studio 2013 Express Edition:

== Remote Desktop ==
xfreerdp --plugin cliprdr -u chrigi 192.168.122.23

== Build stuff ==
in msysgit, because alphacommander doesn't work for git:
* git clone kdeonwindows kderoot
in alphacommander
* cd kderoot
* git submodule init
* git submodule update
* cd emerge
* ./kdeenv.bat
Build stuff:
* emerge kdepim-e5-package
Build installer:
* emerge --package kdepim-e5-package

== getting stuff to work ==
* kde only has a sessionbus
* in $installdir/etc/dbus-1 we need the following files and directories:
* session.d/
* system.d/
* session.conf
* system.conf

== Hints ==
* if there is an execution policy problem in the console:set-executionpolicy unrestricted -scope currentuser
* If jom.exe get's stuck at 100%, kill and rebuild with emerge --make $package

== FIXME's ==
* libkolab cmake adjustments
* xapian-core #include <algorithm> adjustments
* kactivities, comment second _for_each_assoc_helper_container
* kde-l10n-de, the cloned repository doesn't have the same content as the archives, and needs to be processed differently (probably by running autogen.sh and stuff)
* kdelibs windows branch
* zanshin still builds from github

== Running kontact ==
* Run kdeinit4 first
* Make sure to have both the msvc2010 and msvc2013 vcredist packages installed. They are required in the x86 version, not the x64 version as one would assume.
** The DependencyWalker tool can be used to look for missing dependencies, ieshims.dll and wer.dll are probably safe to ignore.
